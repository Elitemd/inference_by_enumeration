<h2>Inference by enumeration for a bayesian network (ASIA)</h2>

The program is made for ASIA network but you can easily adapt it for another bayesian network.

Nodes, network topology and probability tables for each node can be set in <i>ASIABayesianNetwork.cs</i> using functions from Node class

You can find the main algorithm functions in <i>InferenceByEnumaration.cs</i>

Almost every line from the code is commented. If you find any issues fell free to share what you have found.

You can find the pseudocode used to implement this program here
